### How to Add Images to Your GitHub Repository:

1. **Add the images to your repository**:  
   Create an `images/` folder in your repository and upload your images (e.g., `working-example.png` and `ui-screenshot.png`).
   
2. **Use the relative path in your `README.md`**:  
   Once your images are uploaded to the `images/` folder, use the relative path to reference them in your `README.md`, like this:

   ```markdown
   ![Working Example](images/working-example.png)
   ![UI Placeholder](images/ui-screenshot.png)
